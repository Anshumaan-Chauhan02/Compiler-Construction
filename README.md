<h2 align='center'><b> Compiler Construction Project </b></h2>

<h4 align='center'> Project Description </h4> 
Compilers are the reasons why languages such as C++/C are much better and faster as compared to Python. In this project we have created a compiler that does the job of converting C programs to a language that is inspired by Java. Lex and Yacc were used for the task of accepting a valid C language and then converting the program line by line to other language. <br><br>
